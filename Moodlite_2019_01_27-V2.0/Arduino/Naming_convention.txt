Classes 	
	Class names should be nouns in UpperCamelCase, with the first letter of every word capitalised. Use whole words — avoid acronyms and abbreviations (unless the abbreviation is much more widely used than the long form, such as URL or HTML). 

    class Raster {}
    class ImageSprite {}

Methods 	
	Methods should be verbs in lowerCamelCase or a multi-word name that begins with a verb in lowercase; that is, with the first letter lowercase and the first letters of subsequent words in uppercase. 	

    run();
    runFast();
    getBackground();

Variables 	
	Local variables, instance variables, and class variables begins with data type identifier and are written in UpperCamelCase. Variable names should not start with underscore (_) or dollar sign ($) characters
	Variable names should be short yet meaningful. The choice of a variable name should be mnemonic — that is, designed to indicate to the casual observer the intent of its use. One-character variable names should be avoided except for temporary "throwaway" variables. Common names for temporary variables are i, j, k, m, and n for integers; c, d, and e for characters.
	

    int iVariableName;
    uint uiVariableName;
    char cVariableName;
    float fVariableName;
    bool bVariableName;
    byte beVariableName;
    String sVariableName;

Constants 	
	Constants should be written in uppercase characters separated by underscores. Constant names may also contain digits if appropriate, but not as the first character.
